            <b>Find the site</b> that you need a password for by entering it into the <i>search field</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>While searching</b>, previously used sites will show up along with a <i>usage counter</i>.
            The counter shows how many times you've generated a password for the site.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="2">&mdash; 2 &mdash;</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The site</b>'s password is now displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Below it</b> you can set the site's <i>password type</i>.  Some types <i>auto-generate</i> a password,
            others let you <i>choose your own</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>If your new password</b> is not deemed <q>valid</q> by the site, try changing the password type.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>To generate a new password</b> for the site, you can increment the site's <i>password counter</i>.
            Do this when, for instance, you've had to share the password with somebody else.
