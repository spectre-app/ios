        <h2 id="faq">&mdash; F.A.Q. &mdash;</h2>

        <h3>What is this thing?<br />
            How do I use it?</h3>
        <p>
            The idea of this application is that you <b>change all of your passwords</b> everywhere to a password
            generated by this app.
        </p>

        <h3>That's crazy talk.<br />
            Why would I do that?</h3>
        <p>
            Everybody everywhere uses passwords for authentication nowadays.  The theory of password authentication is
            simple: It's a secret word that <b>only you</b> and the other party know.  So, because nobody else knows
            your secret password, nobody else can log into your <abbr>E-Mail</abbr> or Twitter account with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's fine and dandy in theory.  In practice, it's an <b>absolute hell</b>.  In modern times, people have
            hundreds of accounts on sites all over the Internet.  So does that mean we're all remembering hundreds of
            secret passwords?  No, of course not.  That would be <i>impossible</i>.  If you're like most people, you
            remember one or two passwords, and use those for all your sites everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            <q>So what</q>, you say?  Here's the problem: You're not the only one that knows your secret password.  Each
            time your make an account with a site and tell them your secret password, <i>they know it too</i>!  Nothing
            is stopping them from trying to log into GMail, Hotmail or Twitter with the same password and username you
            used to register with their own site.  Even if you only give your password to sites you trust, all it takes
            is for one of those sites to get hacked and loose their password database.  Those hackers now have all it
            takes to impersonate you.  This is, in fact, so common, that it's one of the main reasons people's accounts
            are getting hacked or compromised nowadays.
        </p>
        <p>
            This app <b>solves the problem</b> by letting you remember only a single password without requiring you to
            share the password with anyone else.  Instead, the app creates secure passwords for use with whatever site
            or purpose you might need a password for.
        </p>

        <h3>Uh, so what if I loose my device?<br />
            I'm locked out of everything?</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Absolutely not!</b>  In fact, generated passwords aren't even stored on your device.  No, not in the
            cloud either.  They're not stored anywhere!  What that basically means is, if you grab the iPhone of the
            person sitting next to you and open this app on it with your own master password, <i>it'll give you all
            your generated passwords</i>.  So, if you loose your phone or forget it, just borrow a friend's phone or
            get a new one, and you're back in business.  No backups or restores needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            That also means that, unlike all those apps that store your passwords or send them off to be stored
            on the internet, your passwords are much safer.  Nobody knows about them.  If your device is stolen,
            the thieves can't get at them.
        </p>
        
        <h3>I entered my master password on my friend's app.  It just says <q>Invalid master password</q> and exits!</h3>
        <p>
            For your own protection and to avoid opening the app after <i>mistyping</i> your master password (and thus
            generating bad passwords for your sites), the app normally checks whether you're entering the same master
            password as the one you've been using before.
        </p>
        <p>
            To open the app with <b>a different master password</b>, just go into your device's <code>Settings</code>, find
            <code>Master Password</code>'s settings somewhere near the bottom, and flip the setting: <code>Change my
            password</code>.  The next time you open the app, you can enter a new master password.  Don't worry:
            you're not wiping your friend's passwords this way.  All he needs to do to get back at his own passwords is
            flip the switch again and change back to his own master password.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Great, but that still means I need my phone to access anything.</h3>
        <p>
            Correct.  However, remember that usually you'll only need to use this app once for each site.  Imagine
            you're usually on your MacBook Air.  You go to Twitter, it asks for your password.  You get your phone out,
            start the app and generate the password for <code>twitter.com</code>.  You copy the password manually by
            typing it out on your MacBook Air.  You may notice that the generated passwords have been created such that
            they're fairly easy to copy.  Once you log in, though, your MacBook will ask you to save the password in its
            key chain.  Agree to that, and you won't need to bring up your phone again the next time you log in to
            Twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're still worried, the app's homepage details <b>the algorithm</b> used to generate your passwords.
            There's also <b>a Bash script</b> that you can use to generate your passwords on any POSIX system (such as,
            your Mac).  A Mac version of this app is also in the works so that you can easily get to all your passwords
            without needing to bring up your phone.
        </p>
